        <h1> SMASH  </h1>
        <p id=explain><a id="smash" href="http://www.smash.org/"> SMASH</a>, a program that empowers underrepresented students interested in STEM, assigned us a final project while we lived at UC Berkeley. Our final project was to engineer a prototype that will create change after studying potential threats of manufacturing and toxic contaminants in our communities. Over the past 5 weeks, we have been collaborating in groups of four and learning interesting and eyeopening information in all of our classes. For our final project, we used all of the skills and knowledge we gained in our core classes, which include science, math, computer thinking, and design thinking, to answer our overall and personal guiding question. In groups, we brainstormed, storyboarded, researched and created a prototype that would be presented to our community members.  </p>
