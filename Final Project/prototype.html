        <h2> Solution</h2>
            <p> How might we reduce the amount of mercury contamination that people in Oakland are exposed to? To solve this dilemma, we engineered M.U.S., which stands for Mercury Utensil Set. M.U.S. is a utensil set that detects and measures levels of mercury contamination in food. It also spreads awareness about mercury contamination. The utensils each have a way of measuring mercury levels in your diet when you cook or eat. M.U.S. provides people with:</p>

    <div class=list1>
        <ul>
        <li>A spoon</li>
        <li>A fork</li>
        <li>A reusable straw</li>
        <li>A oven-safe meat poker</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class=list2>
         <ul>
        <li>knife with a detachable blade</li>
        <li>Information pamphlet </li>
        <li>Instruction manual</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
     <p class=sa>With a scale, you will be able to detect the amount of mercury concentration. Since we are trying to encompass people of all income, you can have all of these benefits for the affordable and low price of 24.99. Once the amount of mercury is detected, depending on the consumer's factors of severity age, the previous sickness is variables that could affect the M.U.S. We recommend to dispose or eat fewer amount that week. With M.U.S you can eat healthier and safer. Like our mascot, Hydropeck says, "Check your Meat!"</p>

        <h2>How it woks</h2>
        <p class=p2> The utensils included in the M.U.S. works by using a scale to measure mercury. The appliances would be made out of 14 natural dyes extracted from lichens merged with metal. The dyes from the lichens illuminate a specific color when they come in contact with a certain amount of mercury. That color you can then compare to a scale and find out how much mercury contaminate your food.</p>
        <h2>Goals, Audience & Promotion</h2>
        <p class=p4>When we considered out project, we set a goal in mind to reduce the mercury levels in people and overall spread awareness about the dangers of mercury in food. Our current target audience for this product is the the people of Oakland, pregnant people, people who are conscious of their health, and seafood lovers. The plan we have cultivated to reach our target audience is to promote our unique product through a comic strip, newspaper, billboard ads, and T.V. ads. </p>
