      <h3>Hello, my name is Christopher Garcia, and I go to Making Waves Academy. In the picture I was in 5th grade and we were talking about child labor in Africa for the chocolate business and at this time we were boycotting the chocolate businesses that were known for child labor at the time. A woman from a local news page on the internet heard about what we were doing and she visited Making Waves Academy to photograph our class and take quotes from the people in our class. We may not have done much but we knew we were doing something small.</h3>
